# Rhythm and Binary redirect

This project serves as a redirect to andrewevans.dev from my previous site RhythmAndBinary.com.

There are two pages:

1. an initial page that is reached anytime a user tries to go to RhythmAndBinary.com
2. a redirect page that provides a link to redirect the user to the same post on andrewevans.dev. If the user is trying to get to one of the other pages, it just redirects to andrewevans.dev homepage.
